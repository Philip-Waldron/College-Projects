    This story begins in a world where humans and monsters populate much of its surface, living in disharmony. The humans and monsters are always under threat from one-another, with savagery and war between the two species commonplace. Some monsters can be found living in hiding, to protect themselves from the wrath of humans. The same can be said of humans, who live in small fortified villages and wish to have as little contact as possible with the monsters in the world. Other monsters live in tribes out in the open, just like many humans do in their grand cities of stone and marble. These are the ones who fight the most, eons of old hatred spurring them to attack each other again and again. A never ending cycle.
    
    Before we begin your story, what is your name?

[[Lets begin...|Beginning]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Beginning" tags="" position="945,557">	You, $PlayerName, are a resident of a small town nestled between a large mountain range and sprawling forest. It's a reasonably fortified town, but its residents don't go out of their way to hunt monsters, only attacking those that approach the town. 
    
    You are a bit of a dreamer, and one day you hope to one slay a monster of your very own, just like many before you protecting their home. On one particular autumn morning, it's your turn to venture out with a small hunting party to hunt boar and deer. You excitedly pack your equipment and head out with the townspeople, hoping to stumble across a monster today and prove yourself by defeating it.
    
    [[Continue|Forest Path]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Forest Path" tags="" position="944,696">	You and your party enter the nearby, overgrown forest. You wander around with the hunting party surveying your surroundings for boar, deer and more importantly, any monsters. After hunting for about an hour without much luck, you find your attention drawn to noise of what seems to be a child crying.
    
    [[Stop and listen]]
    [[Head towards the noise|Investigate!]]
    [[Ignore it]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Stop and listen" tags="" position="770,847">	You pause, oblivious to growing gap between you and your party. You listen for a few moments, eventually coming to the conclusion that it can't be a child making the noise, not a human child anyway. With curiosity taking point, you decide to investigate the noise.
    
    [[Investigate!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Ignore it" tags="" position="1096,846">	You decide to ignore the noise and push on with your party. Turning back to follow your party, you begin to panic when you can't immediately see anyone. You were left behind!  
     
    You hurriedly move in the direction the party went, or at least where you thought they went. Flustered and panicked you lose track of where you are, and fall off the hunting route into the denser Forrest.
    
    [[Keep Going|Clearing]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Clearing" tags="" position="946,1127">	You eventually stumble into a small clearing with a faint light glimmering through the tree line. You glance about seeing nothing of significance. As you start for other end, you realise the crying has faded to a small whimper now. You suddenly realise that it must have been a monster you heard, and you feel your body tense. It is only then you notice a lump of dark fur seated under a nearby tree. Drawing your hunting knife, you begin to creep towards the figure. 
     
    As you approach close to the ball, you pause to examine it. It is about the size of a small human baby, covered in a dark brown fur, and it seems to have small fang like teeth and claws. You are surprised to notice that it seems to have truly been crying.
    
    [[Continue|The Monster]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="The Monster" tags="" position="946,1302">	You find yourself hesitating, thinking to yourself *this one is just a baby, isn't it?* It wasn't what you expected the first monster you ever saw to be like; you always imagined it to be a raging beast to come running at you, with death in its eyes. Not a small, sad, defenseless... creature.  
     
    You quickly realise that you can't kill it. As you take a step back a twig snaps under your foot, and the whimpering stops. The monster now becomes aware of your presence, and it seems quite afraid of you. Judging from its emaciated frame you figure that it must be starved. You wonder what you should do.
    
    [[Call for your party]]
    [[Console the creature]]
    [[Throw it some dried meat from your pouch]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Investigate!" tags="" position="945,848">	As you step through the branches wavering off the beaten path, unaware of the fading voices of your party, you slow your stride as the foliage gets thicker. Pulling vines and branches apart you take a few cuts and stings from the thorns and plant life, but motivated and driven by your lust for adventure and curiosity, you don't stop.
    
    [[Continue|Clearing]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Call for your party" tags="" position="1331,1765">{(set: $IgnortantIntelligent to $IgnorantIntelligent +10)(set: $CowardlyFearless to $CowardlyFearless - 10)}
    You call out for your party so you can show them the little monster. It cowers back in fear at the sound of you shouting. Your party responds to your call and you turn to face where you heard them.
"I'm over here, come see this!" you call out, and turn back to face the monster and are taken aback when you find it nowhere in sight. It knew it should hide when other people where around.
	
	Your group enters the clearing, and you wave to them. "What's wrong?" one of them asks.
"There was a baby monster just here, but it ran away..." you reply.
"What? You couldn't manage to kill a baby monster?" They all laugh. "Come on, we should head back with what we've gotten for now, Mr. No Can Kill." They laugh again and head off. You trail behind them, and cast one more look around the clearing before walking away.

	[[Continue|Home Without Monster]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Console the creature" tags="" position="601,1503">{(set: $FerociousKind to $FerociousKind + 10)}
    Speaking softly, you slowly kneel down and speak words of encouragement to the creature.
"Hey there little guy. Uhh... don't be afraid, I'm not going to hurt you."
The little creature seems to calm down slightly from the sound of your soothing voice. Moving slowly, so as not to alarm the creature, you set down your bag.
"Are you lost little guy? Is that why you are here all alone?"
In response to your voice, the creature moves a little towards you. You feel yourself smile at how timid the little creature is. The creature keeps looking at you, and you realise that it is waiting for you to talk some more.
"Uhh... I can't say my monster conversational skills are very good I'm afraid," you say somewhat awkwardly once you become aware that the creature expects you to speak. Nonetheless, the creature covers the distance between you now, and it pauses in front of you.

[[Continue|Console creature part 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Throw it some dried meat from your pouch" tags="" position="948,1502">{(set: $FerociousKind to $FerociousKind + 10)}
    Remembering the pouch slung around your waist, you decide to feed the little creature some of the meat you brought along for hunting. You reach into your pouch to pull out one of the pieces of dried meat, ripping a few small chunks off and tossing them in front of the creature. Tilting its head, it slowly prowls towards the meat, almost as if stalking its prey. It lowers its head cautiously, sniffing the meat for a few moments before pausing.

    {(set: $Eat to (either:"Monster Eats","Monster Doesn't Eat"))
	(if: $Eat is "Monster Eats")[[[Continue|Monster Eats]]]
    (else:)[[[Continue|Monster Doesn't Eat]]]}
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Monster Doesn't Eat" tags="" position="1088,1683">{(set: $CowardlyFearless to $CowardlyFearless - 12)}
    The little creature scrunches its face and whimpers lightly, taking a few steps back from the meat, as if afraid of it. Despite your best efforts to persuade the creature to at least try the meat, it stubbornly refuses every time.
    
    With a sigh you drop to your knees, throwing the pouch from your shoulder to the ground. Pulling it open, you reluctantly begin to gather the scattered meat while the creature sits and curiously watches. As you pick up the last piece, you're startled by the noise of people calling out your name. You look up to see the faint shadows of your hunting party heading in your direction. Instinctively, you turn back to the creature, with the creature staring straight back at you.
    
    [[Offer the creature to hide in your pouch]]
    [[Shoo the creature away]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Monster Eats" tags="" position="818,1676">{(set: $CowardlyFearless to $CowardlyFearless + 12)}
    The creature looks up at you longingly. You give it nod, and without a moment to spare it dives into the chunks of meat, savaging it in seconds. You feel strangely content with your actions, knowing you helped the little guy and that he may just make it through the day. The creature interrupts any further thought With a loud satisfied belch; looking up at you with wide eyes, looking for more.
    
    Before you get a chance to hand it more, you're startled by the noise of people calling out your name. You look up to see the faint shadows of your hunting party heading in your direction. Instinctively, you turn back to the creature, with the creature still staring straight back at you.
    
    [[Offer the creature to hide in your pouch]]
    [[Shoo the creature away]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Console creature part 2" tags="" position="600,1678">{(set: $SeriousPlayful to $SeriousPlayful + 10)}
    You feel very conflicted at the sight if the little creature in front of you. People always said monsters were dangerous, but looking at the one in front of you, you can't see how that is the case. Feeling like it expects something, you extend your hand slowly towards the creature. It doesn't panic and try to run or bite you, so you pat its head gently.

	It seems to enjoy the contact, and it pushes its head into your hand. Then it starts to pat your hand with both of its small hands. You find yourself laughing slightly at this sight. You never would have thought this was possible, but here you were, petting a monster.

	The creature stops and moves over towards your bag and begins sniffing curiously. "Are you hungry?" you find yourself asking the creature. It pulls at the bag, so you take that as an affirmation. You open the bag and fall back in surprise when the creature dives into your bag.
    
[[Continue|Console creature part 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Console creature part 3" tags="" position="600,1852">	"Whoa little guy, what do you think you're doing?" you peep into your bag, and are astounded to see it curled up in your bag with a piece of meat in its mouth. It looks like it's dozing off. 
     
    "$PlayerName! Where are you?" one of the people in your group calls out. You freeze. You had forgotten about them. If they see this creature they will definitely kill it, but you feel a strong urge to protect it. You look in your bag once more and see it sleeping. Hearing footsteps drawing near, you quickly decide to hope for the best, closing your bag, and gently slinging it over your shoulder. "Coming!" you call back, leaving the clearing with a little baby monster sleeping in your bag.
    
    [[Continue|Home With Monster]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Offer the creature to hide in your pouch" tags="" position="816,1853">{(set: $CowardlyFearless to $CowardlyFearless + 5)}
    As the voices get louder, you see the creature's ears twitching in rhythm with your friend's calls, beginning to look distressed. In a fleeting moment, you don't hesitate to open up your pouch to the creature offering it sanctuary from your party. Confused and panicked, it hops into the sack not knowing what else to do. You glance at the creature curled up, shaking from fear. "Don't worry little guy, I've got you." You taut the bag closed and pull it over your shoulder, grunting from the unexpected weight of the creature. 
    "$PlayerName! Where are you?" one of the people in your group calls out. 
    "I'm here! Hold on I'm coming to you!" you call back as you begin to walk towards the voices, carrying a little baby monster with you.
    
    [[Continue|Home With Monster]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Shoo the creature away" tags="" position="1087,1853">{(set: $CowardlyFearless to $CowardlyFearless - 8)}
    As the voices get louder, you see the creature's ears twitching in rhythm with your friend's calls, beginning to look distressed. You don't want them to see you with the creature, or to harm him. "Shoo, run or they'll see you!" You gesture in the opposite direction prompting the creature to go. Its ears immediately drop along with its expression. "Go!" You feel terrible knowing how scared the little guy must be, but assure yourself that this is what's best for it. The creature whimpers, turning its back, and sprints in the opposite direction.
    
    [[Continue|Home Without Monster]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Home Without Monster" tags="" position="1404,2104">	After some time passes you finally make it back from the hunt. *What a day* you think to yourself, as you unlock the door to your home. As you stumble in you throw your pouch and equipment aside and shut the door. You turn around and fall against the door, leaning as you slowly slide down towards the floor. *I can't get the image of that creature out of my mind, the encounter just felt too surreal* you think to yourself, rubbing your hands across your face.
    
    You continue to sit there in silence for a few moments, thinking about what you should do next. *Should I go back? What if it's still there?*
    
    [[Continue|What to do Next]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Home With Monster" tags="" position="708,2094">	After some time passes you finally make it back from the hunt. You hurriedly enter your house and shut the door behind you. *You made it home. You actually made it home without anything happening.* You breathe a sigh of relief, and gently set your bag down on the floor and open it up. The creature seems to be waking up now that you have arrived home. It clambers out of the bag, and looks curiously around the room. You have no idea why you have brought a baby monster home, and you feel like you are going to regret it, but for now you are feeling surprisingly happy about having it around. 
"Well this is my home. What do you think?" you ask the creature as it wanders around the room. It makes a small noise of what you interpret to be approval and you smile.

	Before you start any further, you realise you are not sure what gender the creature is. You kneel down beside it, and you make show pf petting it, which it seems to thoroughly enjoy. You decide after a moment, that it is in fact a boy.
    "So you are a little fella huh? I guess you could go with a name instead of just, 'the monster' right?" you say to him as you scratch behind his ear.

	[[I think I'll call you...|Name creature]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Start of Tour" tags="" position="706,2248">	You can sense $CreatureName's eagerness to explore the new environment. 
"How about I show you around then?" You say offhandedly to him. "It might be a small house, but I have plenty of things in here!"

    "Come on, I'll show you the kitchen! It's where I cook all my food and make it taste good." You walk into the kitchen, and $CreatureName bounds in after you. You watch in fascination as he wanders around the kitchen poking and sniffing everything he comes across. He scrambles up your counter and sits there looking at your jars of herbs and spices. He picks one up and you watch him poke and pull the jar until he works out how to open it up. You blink in surprise. You didn't think he would be able to work out how to open the jar.

	*Looks like monsters are more intelligent than we give them credit for*, you think to yourself. As you finish your last thought however, $CreatureName sticks his nose in the jar and inhales some of the spice. He sneezes very loudly and then gives a small growl in anger at the spice. You laugh as he attempts to rub the rest of the powder from his nose. You are not sure if it was brave of him to sniff all that powder in one go, or stupid, but since he worked out how to open the jar, you settle with brave. You figure you should fill a bucket with water to clean him up, now that he is covered in spice.

    You walk the $CreatureName towards your storage room. You keep everything you have more or less in one room, so you have little lying around the house. When you enter the room $CreatureName starts jumping around with excitement at the treasure trove of new wonders before him.

    Without really thinking about what you are doing, you start telling him about the different things in the room. You wonder why you are doing this, but at the same time, you feel that he understands what you are saying.

    $CreatureName jumps up onto a large chest and then he hops over to another one. He bounces back and forth between the two. You figure you should show him the contents of one of the chests. You think the left one has weapons, but you can't seem to remember what is in the right one.

You walk into the back room where you have a tap leading into your house. You fill a bucket with water and get a cloth to clean him. When you turn around, you see $CreatureName quivering with excitement. You figure he must like water, but you wonder if he will clean himself off, drink it all, or make a bigger mess, if you leave him with the bucket.

    You wet a cloth and begin to wipe off $CreatureName's face. He stops quivering like he had been, and you wonder if he had been wanting to play with the water. That aside, however, he does seem to enjoy having you clean his face.

    Afterwards $CreatureName seems quite content with himself, and then you hear a noise coming from him. "Whats wrong little guy?" you ask him, and you hear the noise again. You realise his stomach is growling. You laugh when yours does too.
"Looks like we are both hungry! Come on, let's go make food."

	You slide the bucket of water towards him, and watch to see what he will do. You yelp in surprise, however, when he dashes at the bucket and splashes you with water.
"Hey! What are you-," you stop yourself from yelling at him, when you realise he seems to be laughing. You stare open mouthed at him. He only wanted to play with you! You laugh and splash the creature back in turn. This goes on for a few minutes, until the bucket is empty, and you are both soaking wet.
"Well, at least you are clean now! But I am very wet, so I am going to my room to get changed."

With that, you agree with yourself to set out before sundown and catch this monster.

    You reach in to grab the dried chunk of meat and pull it out, tearing it into a few smaller pieces and scattering it across the ground. You grab your bag and move out of sight, around the edge of the tree line. There’s nothing else to do now but wait.

    You get some strips of dried meat and leave them down for him, and he eagerly tears into each strip. "Whoa, so you were pretty hungry I guess. Well I still have to feed myself." You get some bread that was freshly made yesterday, and some cheese and you leave two strips of meat on your plate. Before you start eating, you realise that $CreatureName is looking at your bread and cheese. *I wonder if he has ever had bread or cheese before. Will it harm him?*

You set down the cheese and bread and the monster seems eager to try. You watch as it eats some of the bread, then the cheese. You are surprised to see it go for more! Looks like it likes it.

	After you finish eating you stretch and yawn. It got late very quickly, and you feel like today was a tiring day. You notice the creature curled up on the floor, dozing off. "Hey buddy, want to sleep somewhere a little more comfortable?" Its ears perk up to the sound of your voice, and you get up to walk to your room. You look back and see it dozing on the floor again. You decide to pick it up and carry it to your room.

	"Sorry buddy, but I don't know if this stuff is harmful to you." you say to him, apologetically, and begin eating. He gives a small growl of annoyance at you, and then he dashes towards the cupboard where you got the bread and cheese from. He proceeds to open the press and help himself to the bread and cheese instead. *He paid attention to where I got the food!* you think to yourself, amazed at how clever this little creature is. He seems to like the cheese and bread. After denying him some of your food the first time, you would feel bad if you scolded him, after all, he only went to the cupboard because you wouldn't share.
    
    When you have eaten, $CreatureNam begins to doze on the floor. You feel tired too, as it has been a long day. You walk over to the dozing creature and bend down to pick him up. "Let’s go sleep somewhere more comfortable so, eh?" You scoop up $CreatureName into your arms, and head to your bedroom.

You have no idea what you were thinking, and now you realise the problems with having it here in your home. If people found out they would kill him, and who knows what they would do to you.

    You push these melancholic thoughts from your head for the moment, as you are eager to spend more time with the little creature. You look around the room and see no sign of $CreatureName, and you begin to worry. You get out of bed and hurry to check around the house.

You are delighted to see him drying himself like you did! He stumbles a bit while he is drying himself, but he manages to do it on his own.

    Once he is done, he wanders over to you, and curls up next to you. Watching him makes you feel the exhaustion creep up on you from you day of activities. You pick up $CreatureName and get ready to head to bed.

	"What on earth happened to you?!" You exclaim. You hadn't expected this. How did he grow so fast? This only made things more complicated. $CreatureName seems completely oblivious to the strangeness at his overnight growth spurt, and instead proceeds to lick your face.
    
    "Whoa, ok stop boy, seriously!" You attempt to set him down, but he has his arms and legs wrapped around you. You end up staggering backwards, and falling onto your back.

You quickly close the lid and look around the room for something that can gain a positive reaction from him.

    You see two things. You see an old teddy bear that you had as a child. You are a bit of a hoarder, so it's no surprise that you still have such a thing stored away. Next to the teddy you spot a small little gemstone that sparkles whenever caught in certain light. You remember finding it a few years ago and hanging on to it.

    You kneel beside the mystery chest and pull open the clasp and lift the lid. You feel that you are just as curious as $CreatureName as to what the contents of this chest are. It's mostly junk, to your dismay, but $CreatureName seems pretty interested all the same.
    
    He jumps into the chest and pulls out a flute. You had forgotten that you'd had it. "Wow, I really need to clear out this room," you say, half to yourself, and $CreatureName tilts his head to the side in response to you.
    
    "Let me show you what the flute does, ok?" You say and take the flight from $CreatureName. You gently blow into the flute and a soft clear note emits from it. $CreatureName's ears swivel to the flute's music, and he bounds up to you to have a look. You hand him the flute and hope to hear him make it work. He tries, but to no avail, and you feel that the flute has just confused him.

    Watching it sleep is making you drowsy however, and you figure it's time to get some sleep. You have had an exciting day. You bend down and pick up the now sleeping creature. The teddy drops back to the floor but you don’t bother to pick it up. Instead, you just head to your room with the little creature.

    $CreatureName tenses at the sight of the light on the floor, then he pounces on. You stifle a laugh as you look at him lift his hands to find nothing there, you tease him with the light in front of him, and he continues to chase the light. After a while though, you feel that he isn't actually enjoying the light and is chasing it out of a more predatory instinct. Guess this wasn't his idea of play time.

    $CreatureName has tired himself out after his little chase, and looking outside you can see it getting dark now, and you are tired yourself after your exciting day. You set the stone down, and pick up $CreatureName, who is already beginning to fall asleep, and head to your room.

	You keep your sword raised, ready for fight off the creature. It begins to growl even louder, and only then you realise that this is a terrible idea; you don't want to actually kill it!

	You lower your sword and with that your guard. *What am I doing?* You slowly lower your body, keeping eye contact with the creature, and place the sword on the ground, pushing it away. It scratches the ground as it glides a few metres across the grass for a second or two.
    
    The creature's eyes follow the sword until it comes to a halt, and almost immediately transforms his expression to something that seemed almost playful. The creature then begins to bounce towards you like a dog, and dives straight into your chest, knocking you to the floor.

    Despite $CreatureName's confusion about the flute's workings, you play a song on it for him. You think you sound pretty awful after all these years, but $CreatureName seems to love it, and jumps and dances around the room in a surprisingly good rhythm with the music.
    
    After a bit of playing, $CreatureName seems to be getting quite tired, and you begin to feel tired too. You set the flute down, and pick up $CreatureName, who immediately begins to fall asleep in your arms. You smile at this and head to your room.

    Obviously you don't seem to be very threatening at all, as the creature just stands still, unfazed by your efforts. You slump with disappointment as the creature just stares at you blankly.

    The creature quickly scurries to the food, throwing each chunk into its gaping mouth and swallowing everything whole. Wiping its mouth with its arm, begins running straight towards you. You try to steady yourself to no avail, as you're knocked cleanly on your backside.

The way he acts is more adult-like now, though he is still prone to be hyperactive.

    You talk with him for a little bit and flinch when he pets you. You smile to yourself as he does this. He has imitated a lot of what you did in the first few days of meeting him. He started petting you yesterday, much to your confusion.

    You spin around and so does $CreatureName. One of the members of the main hunting party is staring at you with his mouth open.
    "What the hell is this?! That thing is a monster! What are you doing with it $PlayerName?"
"Wait, please, he isn't what you think, just let me explain!" you plead desperately.
"You don't need to, I'm going to tell everyone about this, that thing is going to die!" And with that, he runs off, and you feel the seams of your world beginning to unravel. You notice $CreatureName is very tense and looks like he is about to chase after him, but you tell him not to

 "If he was really so bad, wouldn't he have tried to attack by now?" you say, trying to reason with logic. You can see that the leader is taken aback.
"Well, prove what you say is true then, show us that he is no a 'bad' monster!"
