# Lost at Sea

Lost at Sea is a game designed with the intention of implementing a section of the game, a quest, to be demoed in The Elder Scrolls Skyrim. It was
originally Conceptualised and designed by myself to pitch to a group of individuals, attracting a few to work together to further the project.
This modification for Skyrim was created using the Skyrim Creation Kit and the Papyrus scripting language.
