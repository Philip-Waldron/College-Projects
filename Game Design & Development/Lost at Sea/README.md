# Lost at Sea

Lost at Sea is a roguelike survival game designed with the intention to be initially demoed in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It was originally conceptualised by myself to pitch to a group of individuals; attracting a few to work together to further the project.This modification for Skyrim was created using the Skyrim Creation Kit and the Papyrus scripting language.
