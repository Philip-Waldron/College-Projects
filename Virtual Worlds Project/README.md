Using LSL, Second Life and Blender myself and a group designed and created a functional Apache helicopter to be used in the online game Second Life.

Snapshots of the completed project can be viewed in the 'Apache Helicopter' directory, as well as instructions to build the object in game. This is most easily done in a clone version of Second Life called OpenSim, using a private server.
