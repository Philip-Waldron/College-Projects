Using LSL, Second Life and Blender, the goal was to, as a group, design and create a functional Apache helicopter to be used in
the online game Second Life.

Snapshots of the completed object in game can be viewed in the Apache Helicopter directory, as well as instructions
to build the object in game. This is most easily done in a clone version of Second Life called OpenSim, using
a private server.
