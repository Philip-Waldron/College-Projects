# DCG Project
Although this is not a project from college, I wanted to chronicle this here for myself! It's an interesting project from Secondary School, and I think set me off on the journey I'm on now.

Analysis of design and functionality of various bottles and accessories. Part and assembly reconstruction and breakdown of an existing bottle,
and personal design and construction of a new water bottle concept, all with the aid of the SolidWorks CAD program.
